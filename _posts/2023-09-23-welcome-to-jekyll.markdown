# Setup

## GitHub Codespace

I had stumbled on some problems in my local macbook (symlink and ruby, gem version related) so I put my code on Codespace instead. Following the guides from the _[Giraffe](https://www.youtube.com/@GiraffeAcademy)_ guy, there's a change need to be done for Codespace setup for the sake of user permission (I guess?)
